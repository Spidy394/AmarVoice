## ðŸ”§ Key Technical Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication for all interactions
- Role-based access control for different operations
- Proper error messages for unauthorized access

### Vote Management
```javascript
// Prevents multiple votes and handles switching
const existingUpvoteIndex = complaint.upvotes.findIndex(
  vote => vote.user.toString() === userId.toString()
);

// Remove opposing vote if present
if (existingDownvoteIndex !== -1) {
  complaint.downvotes.splice(existingDownvoteIndex, 1);
}

// Toggle current vote
if (existingUpvoteIndex !== -1) {
  complaint.upvotes.splice(existingUpvoteIndex, 1);
} else {
  complaint.upvotes.push({ user: userId, createdAt: new Date() });
}
```

### Comment Management
- Content validation and sanitization
- Edit tracking with timestamps
- Proper user association
- Character limits and input validation

### Reputation System
- Automatic calculation based on user interactions
- Never goes below 0
- Updates triggered on relevant actions
- Performance-optimized with proper indexing

## ðŸ“± User Experience Features

### Visual Feedback
- Active vote states with color coding
- Loading indicators during API calls
- Success/error feedback messages
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

### Interaction Patterns
- Click to vote, click again to remove vote
- Inline editing for comments
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Real-time updates without page refresh

### Accessibility

- High contrast mode compatibility
- Semantic HTML structure

## ðŸš€ Performance Optimizations

### Client-Side
- Optimistic UI updates for instant feedback
- Debounced API calls to prevent spam
- Memoized components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Lazy loading of comment sections

### Server-Side
- Database indexing on frequently queried fields
- Efficient population queries
- Proper error handling to prevent cascading failures
- Reputation calculation optimization

## ðŸ“Š Usage Statistics

### API Endpoints Added: 6
- 3 voting endpoints
- 3 comment management endpoints

### Components Created: 3
- VotingButtons (fully interactive)
- CommentsSection (complete CRUD)
- InteractionDemo (documentation/testing)

### Database Fields Enhanced: 2
- Comment schema with updatedAt
- User reputation calculation method

## ðŸ§ª Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. **Voting Flow:**
   - Login as different users
   - Test upvote/downvote on same complaint
   - Verify vote switching works correctly
   - Check reputation updates

2. **Comments Flow:**
   - Add, edit, delete comments as owner
   - Test authorization (try editing others' comments)
   - Verify character limits
   - Test as complaint author

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Unauthenticated access
   - Network failures
   - Rapid clicking
   - Invalid data submission

### API Testing
```bash
# Test voting
curl -X POST localhost:3000/api/complaints/COMPLAINT_ID/upvote \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"

# Test commenting  
curl -X POST localhost:3000/api/complaints/COMPLAINT_ID/comments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content": "Test comment"}'
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Metrics & Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track
